Maybe this is my last post on LinkedIn.
I'm production engineering graduated from NIT Agartala with 8.22cgpa, have done my internship in Tata motors, ongc, and cttc Bhubaneswar, area of interest in quality assurance and control, manufacturing. From last few months I'm searching for a job , applied in few companies also but not getting back any response,
But right now I'm seriously in depression
Every company is looking for 10-20 years experienced
I'm totally exhausted
I have ready to work in manufacturing site as well because I love to work on machine.
